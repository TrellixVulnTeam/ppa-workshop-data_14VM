THE PROJECT. n the Spring of 2013 the City Council took legislative action approving a series of rate increases for the municipal  water supply effective May 1 2013. The approved rate increases 35% effective May 1 2013 30% effective May 1  2014  25%  effective  May  1  2015  and  2.5%  effective  each  May  1  in  future  years  are  expected  to  provide  the  revenues for the largest investment in the Water Utility since Lake Decatur (the “Lake”) was created in 1922. The  Lake is owned by the City.. he rate increases will fund a series of lake dredging initiatives over the next 23 years which started in 2014 and are  expected to increase the capacity of the Lake by 30% thereby increasing the retained water levels of the Lake. The  rate increases are expected to also fund further investment to secure secondary water supplies as a safeguard in times  of drought as well as begin to fund a series of investments in future years replacing aging above and below ground  water system infrastructure.. he City issued bonds in the amount of $24055000 in April 2014 for the first phase of the dredging initiative which  consisted of rehabilitating an existing storage basin to hold the dredged sediment to be removed from four of six  Lake  basins. The  $23305000  bonds  issued  in  September  2015  provided  monies  for  the  second  phase  of  the  dredging initiative consisting of the dredging of basin 2 and the Big Creek basin area. The proceeds of the Bonds  will provide monies for the third phase of the dredging initiative consisting of the completion of dredging in basin  2 feeder basins and commencement of dredging in basin 3.  . he  remaining  basins  will  be  dredged  in  subsequent  phases  from  2018  to  2019. The  total  cost  of  the  dredging  initiative is expected to be approximately $90 million. ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS. Sources of Funds.
